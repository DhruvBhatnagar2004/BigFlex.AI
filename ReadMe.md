   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bigbasket-ai-promo-generator.git
   cd bigbasket-ai-promo-generator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   On Windows, use `set` instead of `export`.

### Usage

1. Run the app script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the Gradio interface by opening the URL provided in the console output.
